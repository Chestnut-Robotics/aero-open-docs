# Firmware

This guide covers architecture, build options, and a detailed communication protocol specification used by the **ESP32‑S3 (Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3)** to drive **Feetech HLS3606M servos**.

---

## 🧭 Overview

The firmware exposes a compact **fixed 16‑byte binary serial protocol** for commanding seven actuators (thumb & fingers) and for querying telemetry (position, velocity, current, temperature). It also implements **homing**, **set-id**, **persistent trims**, and safety behaviors on‑board, so a host PC can remain simple.

**Channels (7):**

1. Thumb CMC Abduction Actuator
2. Thumb CMC Flexion Actuator
3. Thumb Tendon Actuator
4. Index Finger Actuator 
5. Middle Finger Actuator
6. Ring Finger Actuator
7. Pinky Finger Actuator

## 🧰 Hardware & Software Requirements

* **MCU:** Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32‑S3 (8 MB flash recommended)
* **Servos:** Feetech HLS/SC family (e.g., HLS3606M), IDs mapped to 7 actuators
* **Power:** Servo rail 6–9 V with adequate current capacity; USB-C 5 V for MCU. We recommend a stable power supply at 6V for driving the hand capable of delivering upto 10A.
* **Tools:** Arduino IDE **or** PlatformIO

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

1. **Select the hand** (left/right) in `HandConfig.h` or via a build flag (see below).
2. **Build & flash:**
   * **PlatformIO:** choose `seeed_xiao_esp32s3` ➜ **Upload**
   * **Arduino IDE:** open main sketch ➜ set board to **XIAO ESP32S3** ➜ **Upload**
3. **First boot:** open a serial monitor at the configured baud (commonly 921600 or 1 000 000). Verify the board enumerates and servos respond OK if power is connected.

## 🔁 Build Configuration: Left vs Right Hand

You can switch hands either by editing `HandConfig.h` **or** using build flags.

* **PlatformIO** (`platformio.ini`):

  ```ini
  [env:seeed_xiao_esp32s3]
  platform = espressif32
  board = seeed_xiao_esp32s3
  framework = arduino
  build_flags = -DRIGHT_HAND       ; or -DLEFT_HAND
  ```
* **Arduino IDE:** temporarily uncomment the macro in `HandConfig.h`.

> Tip: Keep a default committed (often `RIGHT_HAND`) and override via CI or local flags when building the opposite hand.
> Note: You can also use the aero-hand-gui to upload a bin file directly onto the ESP32S3 without using any of this software.

## 🔌 Communication Protocol

The protocol is **always 16 bytes** per frame, both **to** and **from** the device. Payload words are **little‑endian**.

### Frame Format

| Bytes | Field       | Description                                 |
| ----: | ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
|     0 | **OPCODE**  | Command / request code                      |
|     1 | **FILLER**  | Always `0x00` (reserved)                    |
| 2..15 | **PAYLOAD** | 14‑byte payload; semantics depend on opcode |

> **ACK/Responses** also use the same 16‑byte frame shape; byte 0 contains the response opcode, byte 1 is `0x00`.

### Opcode Reference

> The table below is the canonical mapping used by this firmware version.

| Opcode | Name         | Direction | Payload (PC→Device unless noted)  | Notes                                                                                                             |
| :----: | ------------ | :-------: | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0x01` | **HOMING**   |   PC→Dev  | none (payload = zeros)            | Runs full homing & calibration; blocks other commands until complete; returns an ACK.                             |
| `0x02` | **SET_ID**   |   PC→Dev  | `u16 new_id`, `u16 current_limit` | Scans bus for the single attached servo, sets its ID and current limit; returns an ACK with old/new ID and limit. |
| `0x03` | **TRIM**     |   PC→Dev  | `u16 channel`, `s16 degrees_off`  | Adjusts stored **extend_count** for a channel; persists in NVS; returns an ACK with the resulting extend count.   |
| `0x11` | **CTRL_POS** |   PC→Dev  | 7×`u16` (ch0..ch6)                | Position write for all channels. 0..65535 spans each channel’s **extend ↔ grasp**. No ACK (fire‑and‑go).          |
| `0x12` | **CTRL_TOR** |   PC→Dev  | TBD                               | Reserved/To‑be‑implemented torque/effort mode.                                                                    |
| `0x22` | **GET_POS**  |   PC→Dev  | none                              | Device replies with 7×`u16` raw positions.                                                                        |
| `0x23` | **GET_VEL**  |   PC→Dev  | none                              | Device replies with 7×`u16` velocities.                                                                           |
| `0x24` | **GET_CURR** |   PC→Dev  | none                              | Device replies with 7×`u16` currents.                                                                             |
| `0x25` | **GET_TEMP** |   PC→Dev  | none                              | Device replies with 7×`u16` temperatures.                                                                         |

#### Position Mapping (CTRL_POS)

For each channel *i*, the firmware maps host value `u16[i]∈[0,65535]` linearly to the servo’s raw count using the per‑channel `extend_count` (open) and `grasp_count` (closed), clamped to `[0,4095]`. Direction is handled via `servo_direction`.

#### Example Sequences

* **Homing**
  PC → Dev: `[0x01, 0x00, 14×0x00]`
  Dev homes all servos → Dev → PC: `[0x01, 0x00, 14×0x00]`

* **Trim channel 3 by −100°**
  PC → Dev: `[0x03, 0x00, 0x03,0x00, 0x9C,0xFF, 10×0x00]`
  Dev updates extend count & saves to NVS → Dev → PC: `[0x03, 0x00, 0x03,0x00, ext_lo,ext_hi, rest 0]`

> **Framing robustness:** Unrecognized opcodes are consumed/ignored to maintain alignment; malformed frames are dropped.

## 🧱 Firmware Architecture

### Data Structures

```c++
struct ServoData {              // one per channel
  uint16_t grasp_count;         // closed endpoint (0..4095)
  uint16_t extend_count;        // open endpoint  (0..4095)
  int8_t   servo_direction;     // +1 or −1
};
```

* **Baselines:** compile‑time constants for LEFT and RIGHT hands (7 entries each). A runtime working copy `sd[7]` is refreshed from the baseline (e.g., at boot or before homing).

### Homing Module

* `HOMING_start()` — runs the homing routine for all servos.
* `HOMING_isBusy()` — returns `true` while homing is in progress.
* `resetSdToBaseline()` — copies the correct baseline values into `sd[7]`.

### Concurrency & I/O

* **Bus locking:** all sync read/write operations acquire a semaphore (e.g., `gBusMux`) to prevent collisions.
* **Persistence:** trims (extend counts) are stored in **NVS** so they survive reboots; a full **HOMING** reset returns to baseline.
* **Telemetry:** batched `SyncRead` used for GET_*; CSV printing (if enabled) multiplexed through a single serial writer.

---

## 🧰 Homing Behavior

1. Load the appropriate baseline via `resetSdToBaseline()`.
2. For each servo, drive slowly toward a mechanical stop while monitoring current to detect contact.
3. Calibrate the offset at contact, back‑off/settle, then move to a consistent **extend** posture.

**Notes:** Homing may take around a minute or two overall since each servo is given a timeout of 25s to find a hard mechanical stop in a given direction. During homing, other commands are ignored (buffer on the host if needed), So it will wait for an ACK for a given time period.

## 🧩 Extending the Firmware (Add a New Command)

Follow this pattern to add features like LED blink, torque enable, or special saves.

**Step 1 — Define a new opcode**

```c++
static const uint8_t OP_BLINK = 0x42;   // choose an unused byte
```

**Step 2 — Implement a small handler**

```c++
static void handleBlink(uint8_t count) {
  for (uint8_t i = 0; i < count; ++i) {
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH); delay(80);
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);  delay(80);
  }
}
```

**Step 3 — Wire it into the parser**

```c++
case OP_BLINK: {
  uint8_t count = payload[0];   // interpret first payload byte
  handleBlink(count);
  break;
}
```

**Step 4 — (Optional) ACK**
Return a 16‑byte response if the host should be notified of completion or status.

**Step 5 — Update host tools**
Extend your Python SDK/GUI (e.g., `aero_hand.py`) to emit and consume the new opcode.

## 🔐 Safety & Best Practices

* Start with conservative speeds/torque when testing.
* Ensure the servo supply can deliver peak current without large drops.
* Avoid high‑rate position writes during homing.
* Use `HOMING` to re‑establish known geometry if trims become inconsistent.
* Always check power if the servos are not moving.

---

## 🧯 Troubleshooting

* **Wrong hand geometry:** Verify build flag (`-DLEFT_HAND` vs `-DRIGHT_HAND`).
* **Servos move opposite:** Check `servo_direction` or swap extend/grasp counts.We recommend not to change the servo_direction , extend_count can be changed by Trim Servo.
* **Homing stalls:** Inspect current limits/timeouts; verify mechanics move freely.
* **No serial activity:** Confirm COM port/baud and that frames are exactly 16 bytes with valid opcodes.
